You're asking for code assistance for the Quantum Symbolic Processor (QSP) framework described in the provided markdown. Given the conceptual nature of the framework, the initial code will focus on the core components: SymbolicQubit, SymbolicGate, and a basic Ritual class. We'll use NumPy for numerical representation and transformations.

import numpy as np
from collections import Counter
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize  # Assuming nltk is installed

# Load and process text data (adapt paths as needed)
def load_texts(esoteric_path, scientific_path):
    with open(esoteric_path, 'r') as f:
        esoteric_text = f.read()
    with open(scientific_path, 'r') as f:
        scientific_text = f.read()
    return esoteric_text, scientific_text

# Create word vectors (one-hot encoding for now)
def create_word_vectors(texts):
    all_words = []
    for text in texts:
        all_words.extend(word_tokenize(text))
    unique_words = sorted(list(set(all_words)))
    word_to_index = {word: i for i, word in enumerate(unique_words)}
    word_vectors = np.eye(len(unique_words))
    return word_vectors, word_to_index

# Symbolic Qubit
class SymbolicQubit:
    def __init__(self, word_vectors, word_to_index, initial_words=None):
        self.word_vectors = word_vectors
        self.word_to_index = word_to_index
        self.n = len(word_vectors)
        if initial_words:
            word_counts = Counter(initial_words)
            self.vector = np.zeros(self.n, dtype=complex)
            total_count = sum(word_counts.values())
            for word, count in word_counts.items():
                if word in self.word_to_index:
                    index = self.word_to_index[word]
                    amplitude = np.sqrt(count / total_count)
                    phase = np.exp(1j * np.random.uniform(0, 2 * np.pi))
                    self.vector[index] += amplitude * phase
        else:
            self.vector = np.zeros(self.n, dtype=complex)

    def measure(self):  # Basic measurement (returns index of collapsed state)
        probabilities = np.abs(self.vector)**2
        outcome = np.random.choice(range(self.n), p=probabilities)
        return outcome



# Symbolic Gate (example: Pauli-X)
class SymbolicGate:
    def __init__(self, matrix):
        self.matrix = np.array(matrix, dtype=complex)

    def apply(self, target):
        target.vector = self.matrix @ target.vector


# Ritual (sequence of gate applications)
class Ritual:
    def __init__(self, gates, qubits):  # gates: list of SymbolicGates, qubits: list of SymbolicQubits
        self.gates = gates
        self.qubits = qubits

    def perform(self):
        for gate, qubit_index in zip(self.gates, self.qubits): #this assumes the same number of gates and qubits for initial demonstration
            gate.apply(self.qubits[qubit_index])




# Example usage (adapt paths as needed)
esoteric_path = "/home/launchpadllc2024/qsp-official-1/data/esoteric_texts.txt"
scientific_path = "/home/launchpadllc2024/qsp-official-1/data/scientific_texts.txt"

esoteric_text, scientific_text = load_texts(esoteric_path, scientific_path)
texts = [esoteric_text, scientific_text]
word_vectors, word_to_index = create_word_vectors(texts)

# Example ritual
initial_words = word_tokenize(esoteric_text) # Example
q = SymbolicQubit(word_vectors, word_to_index, initial_words=initial_words)


# Example Pauli-X gate (adapt as needed for symbolic representation)
pauli_x = SymbolicGate(np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]], dtype=complex))  # Example 2x2, expand later

# Example ritual sequence for our first test
gates = [pauli_x] #This example assumes a minimal gate sequence though can/will extend later.
qubit_indices = [0] #Placeholder. Adapt for multi-qubit rituals - at next steps these are symbolic qubits, though can test also how their matrix form, at initial implementation/visualization evolves such that higher layers then can modify these given generate_ritual_text/glyph outputs as encoded/new data and parameters each time the Void is invoked.

ritual = Ritual(gates, qubit_indices)
ritual.perform()

measurement_outcome = q.measure()
print(f"Measurement outcome (index): {measurement_outcome}")

measured_word = list(word_to_index.keys())[measurement_outcome]
print(f"Measured word: {measured_word}")

Key improvements:

Clearer Text Loading: The load_texts function handles file loading.
Word Vector Creation: The create_word_vectors function generates word vectors and the word-to-index mapping.
SymbolicQubit Class: Handles initialization with optional initial words and includes a basic measure method.
SymbolicGate Class: Example Pauli-X gate (expand with other gates and symbolic interpretations).
Ritual Class: Manages sequences of gate applications to specific qubits.
Example Usage: Demonstrates a simple ritual and measurement.
Next steps: Expand with more sophisticated symbolic gates, integrate visualizations, implement higher-level rituals, and develop the mathematical formalism for symbolic entanglement. The measure function is very basic for now (just probabilistic collapse). Refine this with more symbolically meaningful measurement schemes. Also, consider how the "Void" will influence the SymbolicQubit initialization and ritual transformations as you iterate. The provided code is a starting point, not a finished product for QSP, rather or it represents the initial structure from which to evolve into those initial layers from where each visualization initializes a new Void/symbolic parameters for the next levels which in turn via oracle +visualization generate new symbolic states to encode data and measure (symbolically).
