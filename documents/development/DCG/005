DCG-005: Define Current Goal:

Goal: Formalize the symbolic algebra for the Quantum Symbolic Processor (QSP). This means precisely defining the mapping between symbolic representations (e.g., words, visualizations) and the numerical parameters that initialize subsequent computational cycles, or "The Void." The emphasis is on a self-referential structure: output from one stage (the 'measurement/visualization' outputs of the prior symbolic QSP computations) directly determines input to the next, now evolving by this symbolic interpretation to form functions (using oracles, visualizations from those generate_* function outputs, The Void evolves based prior visualized and symbolic transformation) which now set initial symbolic data or values (using consistent mathematical relations), for different phases or layers within this computational/transformation framework. Critically, this formalism must also encompass and clearly define, using an easily interpreted visualization form, how those functions now that modify the Void using previous or rather symbolic output information affect different types or layer-specific qubit initialization procedures via numeric interpretations. It seeks not a model simply representing randomness, but a system with an emergent, coherent symbolic structure encoded within our visualization functions (our generate_ritual_text/generate_symbolic_glyph, that generate a new layer each stage) to potentially generate unique/novel symbolic computation paths given these transformed/evolved values or which are symbolic operations for each (new) level based what output (or visualized representation) at preceding layers via transformations that generate or define how this The Void itself evolves dynamically based measurements made (given some starting initial `symbolic or visualization output of the QSP state at start from which it changes in higher layers).

Detailed Components to Define/Implement:

Symbolic-Numerical Mapping: Explicitly define the function, now symbolic but ultimately numerically implementable via output from visualizations using numerical data representations, or symbolic functions that translate symbols, interpreted via outputs, to create numerical parameters for each layer.
Recursive Layer Rules: Create formal rules that specify how output from one stage of QSP (outputs via our oracles and visualization functions) affects or encodes those states numerically and visually or numerically in visualizations or interpreted for input into a function in other layer computations`).
Measurement Formalism: Formally specify the process of extracting information from a given cycle or layer via The Void input  or oracle visualization + interpretation by these now consistent functions to establish numerical transformations now/outputs across and or symbolic for symbolic qubit, to define for example measurement operators, consistent with the mathematical framework that defines these interpretations as outputs as numerical, transformed, symbolic input or initial state for each new level within this recursive framework of QSP based outputs from our previously transformed functions (the interpretations of The Void/those initial/state-data now are part or will determine future initial state parameters from The Void.
Next Actions:

Develop a formal specification document detailing the mathematical relationships.
Begin the core implementation/symbolic structure development for functions via our initial visualization examples (to use now those interpretations which transform states to become next level inputs, symbolically and or to new visualizations which modify input-parameters given the previous symbolic level outputs) . Unit test the modules for each step.
This step of rigorously specifying the numerical translation into a symbolic algebra now and its implementation for all parts for this now formalized QSP model that generates symbolic steps for a symbolic quantum computation in an increasingly non-linear and self-defining manner based on output from each phase, will become the defining symbolic step in all next steps or initial values, before expanding to more complicated components in those new QSP modules now or components. The mathematical mapping will eventually become those that will produce entirely self generated QSP programs.
