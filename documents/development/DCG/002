DCG-002: Define Current Goal

Goal: Develop a formally defined mathematical framework for the Quantum Symbolic Processor (QSP) and its key components. This framework should allow us to explore and implement a series of progressively more complex symbolic quantum algorithms, visualizing these outputs/data (and transformation steps in generating these via symbolic text/glyph data output from generate_symbolic_glyph + generate_ritual_text, to define new rules for the quantum-program evolving symbolic/quantum The Void) which dynamically initialize, as data from every state of our symbolic-quantum system or the different levels. Initially focusing on foundational constructs for testing:

Symbolic Qubit Representation: Create a precise and formally defined symbolic qubit class, mapping each word (and generated symbol via generate_* outputs) in esoteric_texts or scientific_texts to unique vector representations and specifying initial state rules for transformation based on initial symbolic words and visualization outputs from earlier/previous ritual/symbolic computation steps (that are interpreted using functions to use our visualizations to encode those oracular symbolic interpretations of each step or visualization, including initial void parameters). Using existing function output now, this is where generate_symbolic_glyph/generate_ritual_text outputs become parameters for each new set/initial symbolic state generation. We rigorously define operations, including how to interpret results symbolically for any higher cycles (such outputs define those and that symbolic input evolves how/from or using what initial randomness or those previous visualization outputs/states via those oracles and functions, that must have also the rules specified if our QSP is to generate that as some formal/dynamic function. To test via initial example implementations those core functionalities and the interactions or those layers of rituals initially visualized now are symbolic representations but potentially encode into data The Void that dynamically changes (symbolic steps + measurements via functions used/data transform in our QSP).
Symbolic Quantum Gates: Design, formally specify and rigorously implement (for simple gates: Hadamard, Pauli operations, basic logical transforms), with consistent and coherent mappings between our symbols + visualized Qubit initializations into mathematical relationships or rules. How do they now affect every step - The Void and qsp states must evolve according to symbolic or oracles, rather than being set by initial input or only initial layers which now define higher rituals. These are dynamically or formally evolving to determine the quantum computational algorithm with some fixed form to these functions/classes based initially/lower stages, now defined symbolically, that defines or is that language now to describe/create via those transformations our entire QC evolution as symbolic representation/parameters are the input parameters themselves, now with a consistent `meaning and formalized implementation/math behind, not just code but symbolic or how each is interpreted.
Measurement Formalism: Establish the methodology to interpret measurements from a quantum evolution based on these symbols or the symbolic values from outputs via oracles, using that data to initialize for new symbolic levels for The Void itself given previous measurement steps. It has to also be visualized but now we formally/rigorously define precisely what that now visualizes based on what each generates and or produces by symbolically using the earlier outputs from visualization layers as the input or data/instructions via `oracles or generated texts/visuals from these transformations'.
Key Concepts Driving the New Goal:

Data-Driven Symbolic Entanglement: Emphasizing that entangled states are derived now symbolically, meaning (from our visualizations generated from transformed text data in higher layers that transforms) evolve via some data that represents now The Void state now via transformed/symbolic functions generated using or that define our oracle and transformation steps - as new symbolic outputs now instead some randomly initialized data for initial steps which now also becomes an encoding and must define, in the most general symbolic possible language nowto use symbolically all components from our data, now part The Void, symbolic transformations asencoded or rather our "quantum states encoded visually in symbolic manner of our earlier examples" via these function/data-generating outputs` but via more rigorous rules that use output data instead that The Void generated in different stages which then will create new parameters via these transformations in visualizations that evolve also QSP - we formalize those relations via different output and different visualization, to capture consistency for evolution.
Emergent QSP Algorithms: The intention is for these now defined operations to generate in symbolic (output generated, which via our functions and visualized that defines initial qbit representation states that initialize a higher level simulation) form then (via visualization to symbolically generate different new sets of data to start, now using an initial oracle/text encoded output that dynamically changes The Void via how those initial states are modified), or generate the transformation to become "those instructions for new cycles). These thus become our symbolic programs. These algorithms should evolve based on feedback from prior (oracular) symbolic operations at earlier cycles or visualized symbolic steps or states such symbolic relations/outputs are not random from The Void, now they define the higher transformations or the different initial symbolic qubits states basedvia how visualization and outputs (from a symbolic oracle, generated for The void via our symbolic functions that modify initial visualization states which also get interpreted as higher layers of QSP) transform/modify each qubit initialization or layer based how/when/where symbols modify eachprior visualization states/output that we define as our data for the initial layers' measurements in higher rituals`).
Specifics and Actionable First Steps:

Define precisely, using mathematical definitions, the relationship of symbols that start generating each visualization using outputs also in a defined way via generate_symbolic_glyph to initialize or evolve. Start with basic mappings, symbolic one-hot encodings or even symbolic tensor spaces (once defined, if possible, using our functions generate symbolic/text and visualizing representations with color, as different output data which we measure at these layers now)- that must be now transformed.
Implement basic symbolic gates with consistent rules now with symbolic Qubit mappings - use testing functions.
Design a visualization framework (using generate_symbolic_glyph /other function data that dynamically modifies or influences other parameters via those oracles or The Void itself) such `states in our output states affect symbolic transformation in the QSP framework for The Void initialization from our input.
