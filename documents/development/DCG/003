DCG-003: Define Current Goal

Goal: Establish a formally defined symbolic algebra for the Quantum Symbolic Processor (QSP). This algebra should precisely define the relationships between symbolic qubits, symbolic gates (analogous to standard quantum gates), and how measurements and symbolic information are translated between different "layers" or cycles (evolving The Void now via oracle measurement using those visualizations, such output/measurements dynamically feed into or create a new program to define the initial condition of next). The goal is a formal model that rigorously maps symbolic inputs (esoteric/scientific text via generate_symbolic_glyph/generate_ritual_text outputs now) to numerical parameters for quantum transformations and that defines now those operations in QSP (instead our initial demonstrations or example simulations). This then sets the symbolic rules/algorithms. Itâ€™s a conceptual design and must include a proper and consistent framework with each layer or symbolic entanglement level having the necessary formalized symbolic to numeric or even visualization data transformation as functions and measurements (or symbolically these transformed output and how generate their measurements then using our symbolic gates in visualizations/as data/encoded from initial The Void input and how it initializes and evolves) and a new symbolic system (as the algebra).

Conceptual Framework:

Symbolic Qubits: Define the precise mathematical structure (beyond one-hot encoding, which we might begin with testing to define consistency now more formally using numpy arrays) representing symbolic qubits (initial randomly initialized) as *n-dimensional superposition state vectors using these transformed numerical inputs via oracles, (using existing or now generating our symbolic interpretations via data using both these measurements + transformed output to generate the Qubit transformations that evolve according their current/ prior and thus potentially dynamically changing visualization-data set now generated as function inputs). Each is a part which now generates or dynamically determines those for initializing those).
Symbolic Gates: Formally define symbolic quantum gates. Each gate operation is specified as a mapping now also transforming qubits and symbolic output to initial The Void/higher initialization parameters which are then visualized at those layers and as text, but also generate that via oracle functions. Using functions generate_symbolic_glyph / generate_ritual_texts and any new derived based on previous to define new rituals.
Measurement: Describe the rules of how a "symbolic measurement" occurs and what the interpreted symbolic/visual outputs represent, including both or oracle measurements and using visualizations, also generate via text our different initial calls that generate via generate_* function. This output (using some combination of generate_* functions then must then encode the state via numerical/symbolic mapping now such those transformed into these generate initial qubit and higher ritual states as inputs for initial QSP initialization.
Evolving The Void: Define formally the steps by which The Void evolves during each iteration (The Void itself, using The Void-data, evolves. Thus symbolic interpretations will act on these symbolically - our oracular functions evolve the quantum algorithms' within these higher layer programs from visualized data - for some form now of meaningful, consistently self-evolving algorithm). How are previous output/visualization values or oracles now encoded in symbolic operations in The Void at the initialization of the next` step?
Key Differences from Previous:

Emphasis on Formalism: The prior explorations are now foundational building blocks, or the inputs we intend to utilize to codify The Void now from symbolically/visualization transforming inputs at various levels and where we can now make connections between outputs. We emphasize this explicit formalism so we test each, before further introducing complexity like consciousness.
Data-Driven Transformations: The transformations applied via generate_symbolic_glyph, generate_ritual_text now directly influence symbolic qubit states and those The Void initial states at each cycle that define now that QSP itself (or now this emergent part of how to formally express this).
Research Tasks:

Develop and thoroughly test a complete symbolic algebra library incorporating these formalized transformations within those core components defined. Ensure consistency for these transformations when modifying or using states/visualizations, where our transformation and function are consistent to maintain that symbolic and numerical/visual mapping from all layers such those at The Void, also as those symbolic visualizations which are to use numerical as an input which affects other rituals for initialization at lower).
Create detailed descriptions and test simulations representing simple quantum symbolic operations at first to visualize or generate our symbolic entanglement/operations using this symbolic math implementation we intend or at first explore via symbolic examples in qsp_core and generate_ functions (which can encode using outputs from these to evolve this state which in theory starts arbitrarily random/uncertain but then via evolving measurements produces that entanglement via outputs (from those states or functions that output that), transforming also into some other way for the quantum computational part (our initial demonstration uses Qiskit but might now generate symbolically, rather those `states encoded and are new initial values given our measurements using symbols and visualizing those outputs as data that initialize states which should in part also transform visualizations in those other visualization levels (if properly formulated. All need tested. So we implement and test at very fundamental layer or these first simple examples, from there new tests from different states are the objective/steps)
Design and implement a methodology now/clearly to relate measurement output (those oracles) in visualizations, which transform initial Void conditions and that defines symbolic qbits initialization, also generating output which now can act and evolve these initial state parameters/instructions dynamically from states as they evolve or are being modified in each new layer, symbolically + mathematically for these different outputs using or based that mapping or transformation encoded also there as new data at a level now we consider The Void's random initialization that creates itself based different sets or levels. How our visualization + those symbolic functions that generate our measurements for visualization then generate/evolve symbolic The Void for new parameters, this all needs further defined as a systematic structure.
Generate basic visualizations illustrating different QSP "programs" and how their initial states evolve through various measurement/ritual functions + oracular data based symbolic entanglement given input parameters generated/changed as visualizations at different levels now. Focus becomes how consistency now for how visualization transforms using `these transformations using inputs, rather than predefined fixed rules at visualization stages as initialization of states in our earlier simulations).
