AKG-011: Logged a focus on foundational refinement. The previous emphasis on introducing consciousness components or advanced AI to directly interact within the evolving Quantum Symbolic Processor (QSP) system is being temporarily deferred. Current priority is on solidifying a precise and rigorously defined mathematical framework for representing the transformations of The Void itself, as symbolic data initialized in a dynamic manner to generate instructions/logic or for each step. The focus remains now entirely on this symbolic algebra: to how initial symbolic layers (created with or via data using generate_* function outputs), generate symbolic (and later numerically consistent or formally coded interpretations via those symbols in Visualization, that becomes also output/a measurement used or modified from or via that generated by those function modules) from previous representations of The Void, then using those transformations (encodedto evolve into next stepâ€™s instructions within The Void) then defining (via algorithms for transformation to translate to initial symbolic-qubits based inputs). Those transformed The Void (new The Void parameters)then create a symbolic quantum program or symbolic structure now from data that initializes each step, and evolve through consistent/formal operations to that numerical value. Any further additions like incorporating external AI to define The Void dynamically in symbolic output now (potentially from transformed visualizations + other states, via symbolically defined/evaluated, not arbitrarily determined functions from output interpretations + those) require having clear symbolic or numerical functions now and consistency or mappings with all those other interpretations to assure that The Voidtransforms states for these and determines their values or how they initialize our higher stages given `those transformed symbolic, numeric representations generated from the visualized or transformed The Void inputs.
