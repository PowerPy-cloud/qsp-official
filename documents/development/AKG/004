AKG-004: Logged a shift in the QSP design paradigm. The previous focus on "dreaming up a consciousness" as an immediate element is being reconsidered. The current focus is now more tightly aligned with developing a robust mathematical formalism for symbolic quantum entanglement and its implementation within the QSP framework, before integration of an AI observer or conscious element. This is now a purely theoretical mathematical-computational design for initial phases that use The Void as generated by symbolic (oracles + visualizations) and thus are evolving now based that The Void rather than some initial state. These components of the framework—specifically symbolic qubits, gates, and their interactions—are viewed as core building blocks to implement via visualization now a computational algorithm or model via transformed numerical or visualizations of symbolic information encoded as "quantum program via initializations from visualizations as numbers, where these act dynamically, as observed symbolically then as measured statesthat have potentially complex, unpredictable, and ultimatelysymbolized behaviour for evolution in The Void now also which those symbolic representations evolve from. Therefore, generating consistent data at every stage of QSP in symbolic/visualization and symbolic representations/formal mathematical implementations becomes core of first-phase conceptual modeling in QSP now for testof those first phases in a numerical (and with correspondingvisualization or symbol). Then integrate advanced AI mechanisms if deemed feasible using initial structure after consistent testing/verification for symbolic transformation logic or rules/formulation. This re-prioritization focuses efforts on rigorous mathematical definition, rigorous tests with visualization and to transform this data/code such initial visualizations then dynamically update initial steps. Focus now is not introducing arbitrary entities but instead how to demonstrate consistency from these data into a numerical program in a meaningful and also useful manner`.
