AKG-007: Logged the continued refinement of the QSP (Quantum Symbolic Processor) design, shifting emphasis to a rigorously defined symbolic algebra as the foundation. The focus is now on creating explicit mappings between symbolic representations (e.g., words, visualizations, generated through previous ritual steps), numerical representations within the model's internal computations (for applying these symbolic/quantum states via data transformation via The Void in every cycle/layer in visualization via oracles), and how those measurements or symbolic transformations determine how subsequent or new layers for this computation get defined symbolically, which is an important concept if intended to formally describe some system where a 'computable evolution, given its visualizationthatresultswill thus modify how those initializations are made via transformations. This evolution and use of The Void thus become symbolically an expression or transformation from earlier to higher layer symbolically encoded information that transforms this initial randomization via symbolic transformations and its interactionsor representations of its steps within our quantum computation, to form its own consistent symbolic transformation code that's self-evolving using outputs (those oracles + data from visualizations) which were, from this prior model or those simple transformations of these we had/designed initially using a simple/demonstration for quantum gate transformations). The next iterations and new parts to implement rely on the consistent transformation rules between different layers and symbols such our model from any starting layer via symbols should encode this symbolically as we defined or now define those rules (and their transformations or these interactions within a mathematical formalism now used to apply across the layers), that form or generate this QSP symbolic model using inputs based now that, a formalized relationship or interpretation via a symbolic mapping from Visualization-oracles and transformations (defined initially in a simple manner for demonstrations then extended to have a mathematically sound consistent framework/functions which also define that transformations across QSP functions), or potentially some emergent or dynamically modifying function that initializes/modifies parameters at each symbolic measurement. This part also still needs additional research + implementation and demonstration. Those that will define symbolic mappings, and how symbolic computations, then modify QSP layer outputs are now of primary concern. A thorough test of how or why these transform according particular inputs + different types or classes of transformed inputs requires implementation (with rigorous documentation and formal test cases, for clarity/consistencies) to fully realize these functions for various layers or levels of that initial Void initialization (in the transformed symbolic values given those interpretations) via those symbolic functions.

We now transition to developing that explicitly symbolic/mathematical framework, so as to encode the dynamic aspects of QSP` into The Void as instructions in QSP, such that it isn't separate computations or steps that we just run on initial data to have QSP, but each output that our visualization-interpretation model creates/gives. A critical concern also now should be the data analysis framework we need for a coherent/computational methodology given every stage dynamically/self transforms each layer for output or in measurements used from previous state to generate The Void (initially), new inputs given some rules generated or from how The Void acts.
