AKG-010: Logged a shift in focus within the Quantum Symbolic Processor (QSP) project. The current priority is to formally define the symbolic algebra underlying the system's operations. This involves precise mappings between symbolic representations (e.g., words, visualizations), numerical parameters, and how these influence the symbolic evolution of the system across different stages, particularly now encoding the relationship between those earlier visualizations and states. We need a consistent symbolic transformation rule or functions. That transformation of The Void (from inputs), given new rules (using numerical transformations and mappings with outputs) should determine not just next cycle's inputs but should now also create new visualization states, or outputs in those same symbolic function mappings, so it becomes in some way internally self generating a set of rules or transformations from the interpretations/results of visualizations which thus are inputs from output and can then evolve and generate this. To validate now our initial transformations via visualized inputs of QSP components requires precise definitions with consistency for those different visualizations/outputs we obtain via symbols and which The Void would transform now (either visually into symbols then also transformed into The Void to initiate next layers but are the outputs themselves symbolically determined). The shift in emphasis acknowledges that a rigorously defined framework is critical to test if those self-generated systems from this The Void model have potential and can be more formally demonstrated via simulations (given a robustly defined system) of its parts or steps which then evolve the whole via interactions. Without those transformations from symbolic representationsbecoming formal mathematical logic within QSP for initialization + its quantum computation part) which also means now having rigorous algorithms via that representation as code to initialize a consistent form (where those transformations into new visualizations that then can measure those) across each step, but given consistent interpretation in initial symbolic layers are crucial for building that framework/formal model for symbolic evolution). The key concern is now building these as consistent numerical + symbolic forms of representing our functions of this quantum computational engine or rather our Symbolic Quantum Processor(QSP), that generates itself.
