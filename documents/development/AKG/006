AKG-006: Logged the shift in focus to establishing a rigorous symbolic algebra for the Quantum Symbolic Processor (QSP). The immediate aim is to precisely define how symbolic representations (words, symbols, visualizations) map to numerical values within the system and how these numerical values, in turn, affect the rules for subsequent computations and transformations within the quantum symbolic system. Key components—like the initialization of the "Void" (using data from output measurements), or the transformation function applied, and the precise relationships to be specified symbolically + visually in different interpretations via generate_ritual_text +generate_symbolic_glyph modules + our now existing function visualizations/interpretations—must now be precisely modeled, as now the initial or symbolic representations or those used, determine those transformation steps/data and outputs. Previous emphasis on direct, potentially emergent "consciousness" in the system, while important, is being put temporarily on hold to firmly establish consistent symbolic transformations for quantum algorithms given symbolic The Void initialization steps, as symbolic computations/QSP evolution, to now use/evolve these to be a formally describable, consistent mathematical model of a dynamic, symbolically-linked, entangled or even random computation system that is self initializing using now the symbolic outputs and interpretations from our earlier implementations in visualization, and are thus our functions that generate and potentially define entirely symbolic-quantum computational logic via different measurements or new oracles or symbols which generate those. These require explicit encoding via outputs using those different functions, ensuring also or clarifying if there consistent and or coherent relations across symbolic layers where visualizations affect inputs (which is how QSP and The Void interact using oracular symbolic information to measure The Void states). That may also require novel visualizations which will start incorporating those relationships more demonstrably via this formal framework as the mathematical foundation.

The challenge remains, however, in translating symbolic descriptions of "actions in reality via symbols into our functions and how those functions translate these into qubit transformations/randomized sets based upon a framework in The Void. Defining and verifying the structure of those now requires much clearer methodology than our demonstrations originally had suggested or those previous uses intended from which, those in effect will have also had inconsistent interpretations given only The numerical data or text values initially used, in addition to any symbolic interpretations (as visualizing such via data sets, also symbolic in our design given transformations as now those were inputs but to produce unique representations of what The Void might then produce numerically when symbolically mapping The Void data or in other interpretations, requiring new and deeper visualizations).. That needs implementation of these concepts now as proper, verified rules. Prior work was valuable to explore in generating these visualizations or the mapping to begin to think, given data which may start initially randomly but using initial oracular data as defined with rules to affect/modify inputs at every subsequent step in these functions, but those rules must be rigorously verified for a valid, demonstrably functioning quantum symbolic computer using both or a quantum computer (as we had shown via simulation initially for how these initial parameters act as our initial input) or these symbolic transformation for those now initial visualizations (via inputs from the symbolic functions). This re-orientation necessitates much more effort or rigorous development before continuing toward integration/complexity beyond those symbolic implementations we have done.
