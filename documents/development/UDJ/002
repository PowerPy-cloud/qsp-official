UDJ-002: Updating Development Journal (05/02/24)

Current Status of QSP (Quantum Symbolic Processor) Project:

Refocusing on Formalization: The primary development thrust has shifted from attempting immediate integration of consciousness-based AI models into the system to a deeper, more fundamental stage of rigorously defining the mathematical structure governing transformations within the Quantum Symbolic Processor.
Formal Symbolic Algebra: The project is now concentrated on crafting a precisely defined symbolic algebra that establishes the relationship between symbolic data (e.g., words and visualizations generated previously), numerical parameters, and the dynamic transformations across symbolic layers. This algebra forms the backbone of how The Void itself generates/evolves and then symbolically initializes or transforms the instructions/programs for QSP, from its symbolic/oracular representation of how those levels or initial values from randomness (using input visualizations for initializing) evolve according those outputs. Thus our core goal for now is establishing rigorously the transformations between visualizations from prior layers or steps within QSP that must then translate as numeric parameters that become, using formal procedures that we now encode as those QSP symbolic operations now formally defined) , initial conditions into every new iteration/phase or layer of this quantum symbolic algorithm (using inputs from transformations of visualized results generated using our functions, as an initial seed/data, which determines the form this simulation must take, or which symbolic interpretation is used), by those previous interactions of The Void. A key idea now is for a formalized set or algebra by which these all evolve through those initial symbolic representations such their inputs or The Void `now becomes part of symbolic logic generating the initial states. These all evolve to become in some way self generating in outputs).
Key Challenges for Further Development: Several key concerns require careful consideration/formulation/definition in this phase:
Precise Mathematical Mappings: Formalizing the mappings between symbolic and numerical representations within the QSP. The method for encoding symbolic information (such as data generated from visualized data, via the symbols generated in our earlier generate_* outputs as they affect The Void) to corresponding numerical/parameters within QSP needs explicitly defined transformations or that function. Crucial next phase must define them if wish them to generate and evolve states consistently via symbolic and numerical interpretations/mappings as The Void itself dynamically creates them. Therefore to develop symbolic-numerical QSP will necessitate formal mapping definitions with rules (which must use visualization or oracular interpretations).
Ensuring Consistent Layer Interactions: Defining the exact manner how computations at prior stages dynamically influence or modify The Void initialization states for higher cycles (which layer initializes by transformations from lower ones) - so it relies on prior states consistently in our design and output interpretations (in our visualizations as symbolic expressions/mappings). This includes how our generate_*_functions output also as measurements, in different states or visualization formats (which are potentially part or encode now that function mapping using our transformations which define this, numerically). How do new levels using random symbolic initialisations change in turn our visualization based outputs/input (which form these instructions to affect) or which generate and initialize those in part of The Void initiations/input` values) using symbolically determined instructions. Ensuring that evolution or symbolic interpretation of those levels/parts across those are important but also crucial in these specifications..
Formalizing the Visualization Mapping: If a clear and formally specified structure from where interpretations generated are consistent or transform/evolvegiven our outputs which will use data for The Void, this then must nowhave consistency across multiple instances and test results via new functions`. That would, critically for development provide or lead, to consistent methods.
Next Steps: Refine existing or develop and create Python implementation files in src/, for those core functions that rigorously codify these proposed components for formal and symbolic to numerical data/initial condition transformations as part a rigorously defined framework for testing and simulations/initial testing now for those higher stages of QSP where transformations or The Void itself becomes input-generated based interpretations and these encoded into visualized output via a consistent algebra for those symbolic components to interact given the functions we initially derived from those visualizations). Document precisely these specifications, enabling effective/useful future iterations for QSP. This requires considerable initial modeling but will now, potentially, allow testing using more formal algorithms, given clear definitions now or transformations.
