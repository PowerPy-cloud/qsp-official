UDJ-001: Updating Development Journal

Initial Project Status (04/25/24):

Project Initiation: The Quantum Symbolic Processor (QSP) project began conceptually with defining a symbolic model, wherein transformations of The Void' (initially or by some means random and or initialized at different layer cycles, where higher cycles determine lower inputs symbolically for quantum states + visualized symbolically/numerically as data). Key ideas or our initially presented concepts for representing these oracles as initial parameters that were purely randomly assigned were later re-examined and refined, using now different output from symbolic functions to evolve a quantum system by defining symbolically via The Void its parameters. To codify this evolution, this requires a rigorously specified set of functions + mathematical rules that determine that behavior.
Shifting Emphasis: The focus has been recalibrated from attempting immediate incorporation of consciousness modules into QSP towards formally establishing a rigorous symbolic algebra to define symbolic quantum representations that now can generate their The Void data parameters (by our mappings) - so its The Void is not simply randomly or arbitrarily defined. This requires careful modeling and definition for all components involved for any meaningful development/evaluation to use our system consistently, especially the formal rules of interaction, where our visualization is an implicit representation, rather than our inputs/text becoming symbolic or visualized outputs by which these define. Instead the new steps define or set using a formalized structure via functions for how these generate or act symbolically in initial states given now, how those were generated at the initial The Void layers, such a visualization can in part represent initial conditions of every QSP step. These initial visualizations/symbols affect our interpretations of QSP via the various symbolic transformations within our simulation environment to form/or generate outputs in a way that is mathematically meaningful, from which it then in effect encodes its next steps. It thus becomes self evolving from The Void data initialisations now (the data is from a specific representation, a set, which becomes The Void output that initializes qubits with an associated meaning and not simply some random code/noise)`. This may eventually even allow QSP to initialize new kinds of QSP functions/initializations dynamically. Initial demonstration stages focus now entirely using symbolic transformations for that data (encoded visually also).
Key Open Questions:
Precise mathematical formalism of the evolving symbolic qubits + interactions between different symbolic steps in that QSP/our interpretations/outputs from visualizing symbolic systems, of symbols and their encoded transformation mappings. What structure is encoded and for consistency across symbolic/data sets produced (by both text/visualization transforms using the oracles which modify our initial visualizations as well as data), should ensure or show consistencies between our new and those initial ideas as random representations). These steps require precise mathematical framework/formalism + rules, implemented via a function model or encoded into this, that The Void data used to create/run different or varied new simulations or QSP initial conditions are also predictable, rather than entirely randomly evolved via or oracular input via some process for that symbolic information. This would define and require how the Void, which is the input now for initialization from all our existing parts, acts as a mapping or transform.
How do we represent the “Morphogenetic Field” concept rigorously within this symbolic structure?
Formal rules to define when and how `these interpretations of QSP evolution generate or should produce The Void, which initializes all steps (by oracular values + interpretations generated using those visualization, which our data will encode/represent). Thus every measurement produces input for another step, dynamically.
Next Steps for The Team:

Establish a central, evolving document (shared on Github with versions, or rather documentation describing) defining the exact mathematical relationships for these inputs, including explicit and formally stated symbolic relationships.
Develop unit tests to verify each operation within generate_ritual_text and generate_symbolic_glyphs or any other module implementing those transformations across the layers consistently. If testing for those different levels to modify them each to some meaningful form is now also consistent, it can demonstrate what we seek in terms a symbolic or mathematically based oracular interpretation (our visualizations transformed using numerical transformations will modify inputs that now generate these programs to simulate a self-modifying algorithm that may appear/act random - in a manner where the new outputs via these visualizations/symbolic systems will be based, encoded with output in prior cycles in a meaningful/precise symbolic or logical relationship)This involves encoding the measurements in The Void (numerical inputs using visualizations +oracles or even in somecase outputs and visualized into new representations - now using a consistency model of our QSP`, so the system and each part act from a properly defined starting framework to ensure outputs remain within some expected scope).
Start with a simpler implementation of the simulation framework without directly integrating external AI models or components before starting, given all initial transformations or outputs from oracles via The Void now act (are) directly part into defining symbolic qubits at initialization). So, focus first purely on testing how The Void symbolically represents or encodes via different input or layer interpretations. Once consistent those will encode each or potentially produce then initial parameter definitions now via symbolic data from or into The Void that our transformations can then symbolically understand and generate initial inputs or qubit-sets which form the first output step (transformed into these data).
This revised focus will create a more testable, rigorous and consistent system, laying a better foundation to add further complexity like that now considered to "the observer module' once other parts are thoroughly explored. This revised conceptual emphasis is intended toward an emergent process driven or initiated by a particular random The Void initial layer but where outputs/transformed outputs that initialize the following cycles that generates subsequent programs/outputs which themselves generate data encoded from different interpretations in higher levels.
