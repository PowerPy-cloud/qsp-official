# Quantum Symbolic Processor (QSP) Project - Documentation

**Version:** 0.2

**Date:** 2024-05-04


**1. Introduction (Recap and Refinement)**

This document builds upon previous documentation (Version 0.1), refining the Quantum Symbolic Processor (QSP) project's focus.  The QSP now emphasizes a rigorous, formalized symbolic algebra as its core, with a clear methodology for representing quantum computational states and processes through a feedback loop. This evolution prioritizes explicit mappings between symbolic representations (words, visualizations), numerical data defining "The Void" states across different layers/computations, and the algorithms defining symbolic and visual output from QSP. This revised model for evolving states using data/interpretations of visualization+oracles output is designed to not only `describe`, but in its formalized rules to determine new stages given prior, via evolving outputs generated using now this new self-initializing system or program via transformations for symbolic interpretation from output measurements.



**2. Formalizing the Symbolic Algebra: Key Concepts and Implementation Details**


*   **The Void (as Symbolically-Defined Algorithm):** "The Void" is no longer a purely random initialization. Instead, each subsequent QSP iteration uses the output from the *previous* iterationâ€™s measurement-oracles to determine initial numerical conditions that then directly specify, via well defined transformations and function algorithms and/or functions generating them (using inputs now for QSP via symbolic-interpretation inputs of visualizations + generated outputs via our generate_ functions for `initialization, symbolic qubits, data transformations etc), those symbolic algorithms or symbolic instructions. This means all subsequent iterations or symbolic layers are no longer initialized from outside but via how this now *symbolic-transformation model transforms the `oracles `via interpretations of output visualizations for symbolic operations`. Critically these symbolic transformation must in `that stage generate the `corresponding output `(now a symbolic program that we interpret numerically via new functions generated or transformed) that determine our initial symbolic layers via functions of our generate_*` components, generating these functions using data `outputs` based also our prior outputs using this system, symbolically but now codified numerically.

*   **Symbolic Qubits (as Encoded via Visualization):** Symbolic qubits are now precisely defined by their numerical values drawn from data/visualized representation data from output (`our visualized data via function-output of prior layers are inputs now for that and those, oracles/our visualizations form the inputs used for initialization, to symbolic qubits/transformations. These `in turn `affect that dynamic The Void representation, which then acts, again, via our defined functions to produce oracular-interpretations as symbolic function or numerical transformations`). Those interpretations must, and this should specify with formal steps `how`, those `become new input states`. These are numerical interpretations (numerical and or visualization based on prior and The Void evolution steps). The previous, initially presented data representations, of what became our 'visual symbolic measurements now, potentially define some aspect or structure on these computations for those The Void inputs given as an input and then a measure that produces the next layer input `using those symbolic qubit and/or gate states as transformed numerical inputs into a consistent mathematical model or rules defining symbolic `entanglement now and how The Void, in our model acts across levels.`  They will thus have numerical interpretations.



*   **Symbolic Quantum Gates:** Implement and define each gate mathematically (like Hadamard and Pauli-X) in the form now using visualizations as `inputs or interpretations via symbolic output which transform to affect the `data representation` using output from the The Void-level (of symbolic measurements via symbolic qubits `in `our layers)`  such that a formal consistency with their intended effects from prior, symbolically `mapped symbolic-values + those from The Void via `interpretation are present/present and consistent in form.` It means we can encode some mapping in numerical values as instructions, which now represent our evolving set `as programs that evolve The Void based outputs from visualization/oracles from those steps`) or from which symbols (`defined numerically`), via our earlier symbolic representation functions from symbolic `values to represent `and determine numerical states` for how qubits or/states that determine initial values now of `qubits/gates). 



*   **Symbolic Measurement:** Measurement/Interpretation, by design for consistency in these now, via visualizations, `symbolic measurement`, from `the output visualizations or states must produce meaningful values and must transform now`  into parameters that determine `initialization` states for the `new QSP computation layer.` (The mapping from visualization to output, a formal/well-defined/mathematical/function mapping) of these `newly transformed and evolving visualizations in different levels, from prior output in generate_*_function modules or from initial interpretations to those to act/transform`


**3. Next Steps**:

1.  **Comprehensive Symbolic Algebra Specification:** Creating a detailed specification document that captures each symbolic data/or visualized, translation and the mappings to corresponding QSP numerical components  + data (`The Void numerical parameters and corresponding representations that `evolve` in every layer (using oracles via interpretations given visualizing those)). All transformations between visualization, interpretations of The Void now to symbolic-values given inputs via new functions generated from output must `evolve or determine parameters using consistency as outputs`).



2. **Unit Tests Focused on Symbolic Transformations:** Design thorough unit tests, implementing new visualization algorithms using now the specified numerical and/or visualization  output  given any initial input to demonstrate the consistent and rigorously-specified `transformations on The Void`.






These tasks concentrate on creating a formally defined framework before moving into potentially complex symbolic interactions in visualizations using data from prior states via symbolic transformation, which then form The Void using or through those outputs.
