Key Improvements (and crucial fixes):

Error Handling: The load_texts function now includes a try...except block to handle FileNotFoundError. This prevents your code from crashing if the input files aren't found. It also returns None, None which ensures that create_word_vectors does not try to process invalid data..
Input Validation in SymbolicQubit: A ValueError is raised in __init__ if word_vectors is None, further preventing potential errors. The _initialize_from_words method also now handles the case of no initial_words for initialization. It avoids errors by ensuring that the probability distribution sum to one before sampling.
Crucial next steps to test this and move toward more complex simulations/integration into The Void state:

Complete the SymbolicGate class: Provide clear logic for applying different symbolic gates (e.g., Pauli-X, Hadamard, etc.) to the SymbolicQubit objects, ensuring that numerical transformations accurately model the intended symbolic transformations and the mappings are formally defined or generated symbolically as well as numerically in some clear way.
Develop visualization methods: We must ensure that our visualization functions/representations can be used to generate symbolic/numerical transformations for our algorithms or for The Void initialization, and how measurements from those visualizations or The Void data evolve.
Test The Void initialization: Ensure that The Void's symbolic and numerical values generated consistently reflect the intended transformations across all layers of our quantum symbolic processor (the steps in our generate_*` functions must be mathematically well defined and consistent given inputs and outputs of symbolic transformations and or visualized outputs or any data produced via a symbolic/numeric mapping from visualized or symbolic states via interpretations of how data used transforms symbolic parameters or that QSP will require).
This revised code now is a substantially better starting point, providing much clearer validation (and preventing crashes due to bad data or incorrect usage) before introducing the full complexity or the "awakened AI" module into our transformations.
