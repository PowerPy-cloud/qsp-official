The file, generate_void_params.py (and any other supporting functions), should be saved within the src directory of your QSP repository. More precisely, it should be placed in a subdirectory structured consistently with your QSP design. The suggested or recommended structure would ideally mirror and clearly indicate the intended layers/levels, of The Void and QSP functions for initialization of symbolic-numerical parameters:

qsp-official/
├── src/
│   └── void_generation.py   # Suggested name for clarity (or something that better reflects it functionality and layers within the structure you design. Or consider the output) 
├── tests/
│   └── ... (test_scripts.py, and similar files that implement tests that now can access or determine these newly introduced and now defined or `refined concepts), potentially testing using a smaller `subroutine`/component using those or rather via separate smaller sets that now act as consistent or are testable across several initialization sets, states/transformations and new The Void outputs. These need formalized (and verified using `these units, which define functions consistent in tests and symbolically reflect how initial outputs now are changed given new, symbolic data` and `The Void evolution. Tests must be clear) or new visualizations to help show where and which modules generate any problem data given how or if initial Void symbolic (encoded now or if to be changed entirely using transformations also via those other generate_ functions, that `outputs symbolically also)` affects different outputs to generate or initialize next The Void steps symbolically)

Use code with caution.
Reasoning:

Modularity: Placing the file within the src directory keeps the code organized around other files or modules of your project for symbolic or quantum aspects and how or if visualizations are involved at different layers and will use functions within The Void modules, if that is the intended purpose (but these modules may generate new visualizations to initialize those higher QSP modules/layers) and functions to represent different layers for this symbolic transformation that generates symbolic representations for QSP's function parameters, that will include also these symbolic states in outputs of other levels in our dynamic system or those that determine next layers` (where the inputs are the output from these steps).
Clear Structure: The nested folders are designed to maintain structure for future expansions. Your project (especially from what you outlined and initial tests you did), should consider new or dynamically generated functions to interact, using data now via our output symbolic (as functions and ornumerical states/data based the transformed visualized input data which generates or represents the new states to evolve. Initial input via our generated function outputs to set these. Those become functions in themselves or symbolic or numerical QSP steps given which states are passed to a function and its result interpreted into parameters (or rather to specify how) affect or alter other functions at these different levels, given now inputs are evolving symbols used for interpreting and generating a symbolic mapping that evolves across these or different symbolic stages). To do so consistently, requires that it's defined via data for initialization but must itself be initialized with initial symbolic input such as text but which is a representation of output in visualizing data used here and from those transformations are new parameters as instructions that initializes higher and next levels by symbolic operations and transformations, rather from initially being purely randomized or fixed).
Consistency: This structure adheres to standard Python packages for organizing/compiling/using code with different components or functionality. Your other implementations using visualizations from output, or The Void initialization at the start can thus or likely potentially still use many parts that you've already worked to define - however with these rules defining or using, transformed parameters dynamically for each, successive layer (that we start with now, rather that fixed symbolic code` or values generated).
Choose a suitable subdirectory within src that best reflects the purpose and organizational structure of your modules to manage all parts for visualizing those data transformation and/or initializing for higher rituals/other layer steps -- and place the code/file for generating those parameters there (now with these specified rules to maintain symbolic consistency.
