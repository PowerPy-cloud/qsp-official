Python
Explanation and Crucial Improvements:

Error Handling: Thorough error handling to check whether files load successfully, for each method (tokenize, other function call, whether using correct/suitable Python data types to process files correctly) prevent runtime errors/exceptions due to corrupt file data, non-existent files or inconsistent or poorly implemented procedures during symbolic or numerical translation for QSP.
Data Flexibility: These scripts are now more flexible. For now the input text could either define/start these, either purely by initializing numerically as before, or through another symbolic mapping as well for The Void now to transform into that for visualization. These are separated out for code consistency such in initial stages each layer will thus have predictable behavior using that new formalized algebra to ensure any implementation is indeed doing what you intend or represents consistently/robustly, given initial visualization output can affect how QSP then determines new transformations, by also formally implementing these mappings across layers given those transformations in generate_* function or oracle (in symbolic form from visual) to also create/generate new initial symbolic states or parameter values) as well).
Improved Visualization Function: A proper visualize_* function that takes either numeric data (like array-representations as intended, but symbolic ones given or generated as outputs from generate_* functions/components now part the whole symbolic function to initialize or change QSP). The outputs visually now for consistency can clearly represent each of those steps/cycles or a meaningful data interpretation given a symbolic input to The Void which acts as these new layer inputs as output via a function/program - for our QSP that also outputs a consistent model (both numeric and symbolic)- now where outputs should not merely be arbitrary but will have consistent interpretation, given inputs in each cycleor transformed data used for visualizations of initial states. These should start creating a system based outputs but can generate via interpretations for output new, or the new state to compute these are not trivial but some form/relation that those inputs affect symbolically which are transformed into parameters from visualization layers from The Void via our outputs to evolve states of higher QSP,
Explicit Output Locations/Files: Creates and thus avoids error or missing values, or the case it couldn't write or potentially overwrote - now outputs the symbolic/or numeric data. Includes those to a folder in which QSP or symbolic functions may generate symbolic instructions or functions from a different or higher oracular-visualization set and modify/affect every layer using visualization data, which acts part the program. The data in those different output steps from the The Void which use input parameters from all those various or even dynamically changed given the symbolic functions to measure symbolic/visualization interactions that initializes those via an evolving (rather than being static input values generated from somewhere or initial layer).
With these refinements, the scripts are considerably more robust for testing our basic functions. Initial testing with clear documentation of how The Void initialization states transform or evolve through each step of our various components will generate results easier to visualize + analyze given the specific data using a formally represented, symbolic/visualization framework for symbolic states, rather that arbitrary symbols now. Testing which values to transform, when transformed and the relationship to the initial states, will be crucial or how symbolic interactions are now translated.
