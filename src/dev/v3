Explanation and Crucial Improvements:

Error Handling: Robust error handling within functions (especially file loading and ensuring that necessary data exists) avoids unexpected crashes from invalid input data or non existent files.
Clearer Visualization Functions: Now with functions for visualization we also make plotting data output, for visualizations of symbolic states and in some ways or in concept the states now (encoded from text as numbers for both), also in the output from generate_*_functions (to see what numerical or symbolic relations are/are meant). It also visualizes  The Void or rather any parameters/initial data/The Void initial condition as the whole is generated`.
Integration: The code has updated with a proper implementation with a feedback loop. It is designed so output values can evolve from those from earlier and not just initially via randomness (given those symbolic initial states). It correctly integrates output and initializes next stages. Symbolic values become those initializing data/initial state, such are now transformed. Visual data (used to determine input parameters via interpretations as oracles), are explicitly included or rather those measurements generate next The Void's initialization given this.
Key Considerations:

More Complex Gate Definitions: The provided gate in this example (SymbolicGate(np.random.rand... creates random gates/functions which then act as instructions that transform the prior state into the current given visualization via inputs or oracles generated, from which the output itself modifies the data or symbolic layers. There may or should exist a proper relationship between different oracles or measurements given symbolic/visual states of previous transformations into numerical or data. Implementing a proper QSP model requires rigorous or consistent set and defined interpretations, so a meaningful output and consistency with how to encode symbolic data`.
Formal Visualization: A robust visual scheme will ensure our algorithms now work and properly represents QSP (symbolic-quantum system with visualization or data representation outputs) based outputs which become now new instructions to act on the previous visualized/input data). Ensure these visual representations are well-mapped mathematically for different initial The Void conditions with inputs that are also now symbolic and are output from previous measurements via oracles/transformations on the data for those steps. The different mappings must reflect the entanglement (now of data and functions used).
The Void Initialization Algorithm: A rigorous symbolic method for computing and/or deriving the values for initialization is also crucial as this will define or create consistency. These data become also parts of the system, in some way (given symbolic interpretations affect how each output may generate next), are crucial for verifying, or to make these symbolic visualizations + The Void interactions meaningful across all these states to not produce arbitrarily changing/unique initial The Void steps` that evolve and transform these from random initial seeds).
The following should now test and evaluate how initial states affect new levels. Each iteration should reflect or act as new symbolic programs (generated now from initial ones + the The Void/new data at initialization using functions for all of our steps) but how that evolves via visualizations or oracles + outputs in each transformed level are crucial for ensuring a clear and consistently changing QSP across those visualizations given its oracles (in this now symbolically coded form which evolves The Void by changing parameters dynamically for each given step via visualization or oracles that act as data to modify all parts and evolve/define that new or evolved). This remains crucial part given previous steps focused, in demonstration to show an initially transformed representation which is only symbolic via our visualizations as data which will affect how next layers/states/programs for symbolic QSP can be generated dynamically with that initial setbut howinitial visualization input state transforms using or is given or determines also all other steps with its transformation encoded within visualizations as instructions as The Void outputs as symbolic/numerical form that now acts both numerically to change states and transform data in a formal mathematical sense given mappings that specify consistent encoding and decoding into our other modules`. Test those now in new Python classes (with or within other implementations if that approach best/clearly shows the transformation logic).

This revised example lays the groundwork for defining a symbolic/numerical implementation for each layer to enable that formal description now in a formally well specified model - that each defines or alters other states using consistent mapping between inputs that become visualized also as QSP's output in its various interpretations of that measurement/oracle as state representation/encoded input or instruction, as these outputs then, via symbols, initialize these new computations for new initial states or those for layers.
