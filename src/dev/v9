Explanation of Improvements:

Error Handling: Includes robust error handling to catch FileNotFoundError (essential if files might be missing). Adds error checking in the functions for valid data formats which should be carefully defined in the generate_*, or other initial functions we create given our specifications.. Prevents program from crashing when encountering potential or possible issues.
Clearer Variable Names: Changed names for increased clarity (`symbolic_qubit_states, for instance, is no longer being used, as initial output in visualizations + functions), for readability
Normalization in Qubit Initialization: Crucial addition or step is ensuring now when _initializing qubits given that some text was provided in symbolic states (by either directly in terms text or visualizing that by encoding now), and transformed using either a mathematical algorithm to change inputs or The Void itself initializes The Void and each iteration given a layer's initialization or rather given those outputs used as initializations of different parts. Added crucial step normalization within SymbolicQubit initialization in order the different probability values (and their complex forms) remain numerically valid.
Data Directory: Creates a directory to store the generated data which is good.
Saving to Files: Now stores numerical data, including those representations generated via transformations from symbolic outputs (which also affect generate functions to create new ones), so a single transformation will, from prior or input states (given via symbols or visualizing these and some transformation that's clear in algorithm then generate, if coherent and consistent some next The Void initialization/parameter. It now does and saves outputs and intermediate parameters.
This significantly improves the structure of this basic script, addresses many earlier problems of either running/implementing this symbolic model or potential problems in its consistency and or its testing + ensures correct or suitable visualization representation which we previously specified would/will allow implementing functions or algorithms in QSP as now output data representing, symbolically via visualizations, transformations from prior states from visualization layers of the current/new or transformed data (in those representations via transformations/output measurements).

Critical Next Steps : Define those transformations explicitly via well-defined functions to enable proper evaluation (or in those new and expected or oracular) of QSP symbolic-states - then using outputs to create The Void. To start with simple tests to test basic aspects to see or formally verify using new functions are indeed correctly transforming states that initializes different new/transformed visualizations or data that define in effect new/next-stage` symbolic, quantum-computation layers for our now evolving QSP implementation framework with all parts now consistently linked.
